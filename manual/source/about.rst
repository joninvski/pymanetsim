Intro
=====

`PyManetSim <http://manel.pt>`_ is a simulator for quickly test protocols in manet and ad-hoc networks. It aims at simplicity and being able to be extended to each individual need.

You should use PyManetSim if you work in want to see if an idea works. The simulator engine is simply a broker for messages and a plane in which nodes are located. The logic is that you quickly implement your test protocol and the simulator makes the boring job of simulating that messages are sent between nodes in the plane. It also deals with the passnig of time.

What it is and what it is not
=============================

**PyManetSim is:**
 * Easy to test new ideas for protocols
 * Programmed in python which is a very cool language for quicky developing new prototypes
 * Easy to start. Small learning curve.
 * Easy for users to extend to suit their specific need.

**PyManetSim is not**:
 * Fast
 * Suited to simulate TCP/IP stack (or any other stack for that matter)
 * Stable

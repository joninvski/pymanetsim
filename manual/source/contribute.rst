How to contribute
=================

Everyone is welcome to help with the development of PyManetSim.
There is a todo file in the root of the git tree (you can use that with yaGTD).

In there I add the main tasks and approximately how long it will take. However I might be a bit behind on the tasks.

Talk about development
======================

You can talk with developers or people interested in the development on the mailling list.

To start development just clone our public GIT repository and start working on it::

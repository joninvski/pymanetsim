TODO List

Hard
====

* Introduce the idea of nodes moving
* Test direct messages correctly
* Test messages with power correctly
* Create Real simulation events
* Divide the protocol in: node, manager, events, messages

Medium
======

* A simple protocol that propagates a message in an epedemic way
* Implement the proactive protocol (OLSR)
* Move route found event to the be an asynchronous event
* Increase First tutorial with automatic simulator parameters
* Put the mapbuilder as an plane parameter so it can be changed as the user wants it

Easy
====


Results from the 1st reunion
============================

* Use gradients to improve the path
* Keep making the distinction from normal ("hello") heat from "return route heat"
* When the protocol is in the go back messages if the path is broken why not do an epidemic broadcast with max_hop equal to the remaining missing nodes
* **I Have to come up with a real case where this problem has some logic**
